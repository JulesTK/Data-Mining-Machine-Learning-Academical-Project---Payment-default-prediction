# Data-Mining-Machine-Learning-Academical-Project---Payment-default-prediction
The objective is the creation of a model for predicting the risk of payment default for customers and its application to the instances to be predicted. We therefore wish to use classification techniques to generate a model for predicting the class of clients :

- default = yes (positive)
- default = no (negative)

Several classifiers will be generated and tested by applying the different classification methods and adjusting the parameters to optimize the results. Only the most efficient classifier will be kept, knowing that the main objective is to minimize financial risks by avoiding wrongly granting a loan.
The selected classifier will then be applied to the dataset to be predicted in order to predict for each client whether he is likely to default (default class = Yes) or not (default class = No).
